# WebTechProject
Mini CMS as a school project


## Functional requirements
- User login
- Tokens per user (to gain acces to subdomain per user)
- Admin can edit site
  - Add pictures
  - Edit site elements; pictures, posts, ...
  - User rights
  
Standard pages: posts, pictures
Quality: should be easily expandable

## Documentation - Process highly inspired by [Wix](https://www.wix.com)
Upon installing the software, you should visit ```www.website.com/admin``` where ```website``` is your own domain name (or IP-adress).

From here onwards, select a certain template. Choosing ```No template``` will allow you to create everything from scratch. However this might take longer.

<!-- As this project is just a beginner project, only several templates are available. Luckily these can be easily inserted by other contributors -->
<!-- These might be templates at first, but should become categories when there are many templates in the long run, such as "business" and "blog" -->
